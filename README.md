Words from a fresh web dev: 

This project will be my first attempt at making a website that is linked to an sql database. I have never actually worked out of a database before this, but I am finding that it is not nearly as intimidating as I first thought. This project is purely for educational purposes and is not intended to ever reach production. However, I hope to complete it to a point that would be considered production ready. The goals of this project are:

- Create a dynamic web site generated from a mysql database
- Make an authentication method from scratch
- Maintain a minimal package.json
- Avoid jquery, maybe learn react some time in the future when the backend is built up

This will also be my first time working with git, so I apologize if my commit messages don't sound completed or competant. 


### V1.1
  Initial functional version of the project
